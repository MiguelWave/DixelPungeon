=====DIXEL PUNGEON=====

Based on watabou's Pixel dungeon.

It is a time of magic, monsters, adventures and mysteries, and there is nowhere one can find a better convergence of those than in dungeons. While their true origins remain unbeknownst to all, some would debate that these rabbithole-like underground structures are ancient ruins left by a bygone civilization of a forgotten humanity, others would argue that they are civilizations in their own right formed by a hierarchy of monsters, others still, forebode that they are but gateways to an foreign realm, teeming with death and destruction waiting to be unleashed upon the realm of humans through the hands of an ill-fated soul. Grim and ominous though the tales of old may be, they do little to deter the adventurers that come to these dungeons seeking fame, fortune, knowledge, or at the very least, some fun. You, one such adventurer, unexperienced as you are, dicided to "go with the flow" when your friends came knocking with backpacks and swords, only to find yourself lying on the ground in unknown depths of a dungeon, amnesiac, without company aside from the head-splitting migrains and your ever growing fear of darkness, and the only light to shine upon you seems to be coming from further into the dungeon...

If all that's a little too much for a 2-bit dungeon crawler game made by an unexperienced uni undergraduate then you can just leave it at unfinished_forgettable_game#238293

---How to play---

Since the game is still in its alpha stages, the rules are fairly simple: avoid the enemies (the red blocks) and get to the exit (the green block) using WASD.
You can also create your own map with instructions in map.txt.
